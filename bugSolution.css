The issue lies in the spacing within the `calc()` function and potentially missing multiplication operators. Here's how to fix it:

Incorrect (bug.css):
```css
.element {
  width: calc(200px + 50px ); /* Extra space around + */
  height: calc(100px + 50% ); /* Missing * */
}
```

Corrected (bugSolution.css):
```css
.element {
  width: calc(200px + 50px);
  height: calc(100px + 50%*1); /* Explicit multiplication */
  /* Or use a more readable version for percentage */
  height: calc(100px + 50% );
}
```

Always carefully review the spacing in your `calc()` expressions and be mindful of the order of operations.  Use parentheses for complex calculations to avoid ambiguity.
